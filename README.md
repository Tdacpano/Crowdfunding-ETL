# Crowdfunding-ETL
In this analysis we were able extract, transform, and load data that contained information about Independent Funding, a crowdfunding platform for funding independent projects or ventures. We performed both an ETL process on this dataset and a data analysis by using SQL queries. We were able to extract data from a csv file, transform and clean the data into appropriate tables. We then created a ERD to visualize our data in order to load it. We finished by writing queries in SQL to create tables that provided the first name of each contact, the last name, the email address, and the remaining goal amount (as "Remaining Goal Amount"). We even sorted the data in descending order for the amount remaining and also by email.
